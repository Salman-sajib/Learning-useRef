# React useRef()

In this small project I have learned about the useRef() react hook.

### The differences between useState() and useRef() React hook

### useState()

- Re-renders the component when the state value changes.

### useRef()

- "use Reference" Does not cause any **re-renders** when its value changes.
- When you want a component to **remember** some information but don't want that information to trigger new renders.

### When useRef() is useful

1. Accessing/Interacting with **DOM** element
2. Handling **Focus**, **Animation** and **Transitions**
3. Managing **Timers** and **Itervals**
